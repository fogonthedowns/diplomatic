0) Loop through moves and determine if the destination is contested

1) ✅ Resolve all uncontested moves
   a) ✅ is the move possible? If so Update the move.ResolvedMove
   b) ✅ if not? Hold 

2) ✅ Collect all support orders
   a) ✅ determine if the support has been cut.

3) ✅ Collect all convoy orders
   a) ✅ determine if the path has been disrupted
   b) ✅ determine if the path is complete

4) resolve all contested moves
   a) ✅ will the piece move out of the way?
   b) ✅ is there support?

5) Edge cases
   a) Spain
   b) Bulgaria
   c) St. Petersburg

final) loop through all moves:
    a) ✅ update the pieces.Location by move.piece_id
    b) update the territory.Owner by move.PieceOwner 

design considerations:

✅ you can not attack your own territory
✅ you must be able to issue support and convoy orders for others
Players who have not issued moves, will issue hold orders


Check:
    a) verify the piece exists
    b) Verify you own the piece.
    c) verify the piece is at the matching start location 


Phase change: 
    1. update game_year on pieces
    2. update phase on pieces 

Finds the pieces that haven't moved:

select pieces.id, moves.location_start, pieces.location, pieces.owner, pieces.type from pieces LEFT JOIN moves ON pieces.id=moves.piece_id where pieces.game_id=1 and pieces.game_year=1901 and moves.location_start is NULL;

phase and game_year should also be on pieces, and stay on moves for historical record.
